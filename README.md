# PS-Superresolution
Merge multiple images together in Photoshop in order to enhance them

#Instructions
Put the SuperResolution.js file into the scripts folder for example in Windows: "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 20##\Presets\Scripts"

Open Photoshop and the script should be available from the "File / Scripts" menu.

Select multiple files, the files must be the "same" or multiple pictures of the same subject without movement, the script stacks them together into layers with their respective opacity percentage. By doing it the script helps to remove the noise and improve the image quality in general, the more images the better but in theory you won't see much difference after a few, 4 to 20 images probably.

You can also use diferent images if you want of course, for example to make ghostly effects or just add random images, the images must have the same width and height.
